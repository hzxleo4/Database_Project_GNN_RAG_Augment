## Get Started
We have simple requirements in `requirements.txt`. You can always check if you can run the code immediately.

Please also download `entities_names.json` file from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ifgVHQDnvFEunP9hmVYT07Y3rvcpIfQp?usp=sharing, as GNNs use the dense graphs.

Please also download 'test.json' file from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-wCf3DGj5xVAWkHScBrZQ3Xpy9M5WcC3?usp=sharing, and put this test.json file in /results/gnn/{DATA_SET}/rearev-sbert/ and /results/gnn/{DATA_SET}/rearev-lmsr/ , as LLM use the dataset as test.

## Evaluation
We provide the results of GNN retrieval in `results/gnn`. To evaluate GNN-RAG performance, run `scripts/rag-reasoning.sh`.
